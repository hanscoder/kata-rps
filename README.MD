# Kata: Rock-paper-scissors

## Part One:

Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game usually played between two players.
Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with one hand.
These shapes are rock (fist), paper (flat hand), and scissors (index and middle fingers form a V).

The rules are simple:

* Rock beats scissors.
* Scissors beats paper.
* Paper beats rock.
* Same shapes lead to a tied game.

Implement this in a way that you have three objects which represent the different shades.

Use acceptance tests to let the shades play against each other and validate which one has won,
has lost or if it was a tied game.

### Goal

The goal is to practice Object-oriented design using the programming language Java.

## Part Two:

Damn it, you have finished your work but there are always changes in life.
Some people want to play Rock-paper-scissors-spock-lizard now.

We have additional rules:

* Rock beats lizard.
* Spock beats scissors.
* Scissors beats lizard.
* Lizard beats paper.
* Paper beats spock.
* Spock beats rock.
* Lizard beats spock.

### Goal

Validate/Discuss whether your design is good or not.

* Are the enhancements very easy?
* Do the enhancements have any possible side effects?
